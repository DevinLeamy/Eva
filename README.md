### Structure

-   `/wall-e`: The Rust ray-tracing library.
-   `/wall-e-py`: Rust Python3 bindings, for scripting.
-   `/wall-e-py/assets/meshes`: Contains `.obj` mesh files.
-   `/wall-e-py-macros`: Rust macros used in `/wall-e-py`.
-   `/scripts`: Scripts (scenes) you want to render.
-   `/images`: Images from the scenes requested in the assignment guidelines.
-   `SCRIPTING.md`: Documentation for the scripting API.

### Setup

> _Note: You will need to have Rust and Python3 installed on your system._

Create a virtual environment and install `maturin`.

```bash
cd wall-e-py
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install maturin
deactivate
```

### Usage

Scripts, which are python3 files, are put in `/scripts`.

To run a script `./scripts/custom-script.py`, from the root folder, call

```bash
# No debug output.
./run.sh custom-script
# With debug output.
./debug.sh custom-script
```

Or, alternatively:

```bash
cd wall-e-py
source .env/bin/activate
maturin develop
cd ..
python3 ./scripts/custom-script.py
```

Rendered images, by default, are placed in the root folder.
